                        <h3>E-commerce Platform Scalability Enhancement</h3>
                        <p class="project-summary">Revamped a struggling e-commerce platform to handle high traffic, eliminating downtime during peak sales.</p>
                        <div class="project-details">
                            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                            <p>The client's existing e-commerce platform was experiencing frequent crashes during peak sales periods (e.g., Black Friday), leading to an estimated **15% loss in potential revenue** due to abandoned carts and frustrated customers. Manual inventory tracking also caused stockouts and overstocking.</p>

                            <h4>My Solution</h4>
                            <p>After a thorough system audit, I identified bottlenecks in database queries and inefficient server configurations. I implemented a caching mechanism using **Redis**, optimized database indexes, and migrated the platform to a scalable **microservices architecture on AWS (EC2, RDS)**. For inventory, I developed a real-time tracking system integrating with their POS, triggering automated reorder alerts using **Node.js** and **PostgreSQL**.</p>

                            <h4>Measurable Results</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Platform uptime increased to **99.9%**, eliminating peak-time crashes.</li>
                                <li>Page load times reduced by **40%**, contributing to a **10% increase in conversion rates**.</li>
                                <li>Automated inventory system reduced stockouts by **80%** and streamlined order fulfillment by **30%**.</li>
                                <li>Overall operational costs decreased by **5%**.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Automated Customer Support Ticket Routing</h3>
                        <p class="project-summary">Developed an intelligent system to automatically route customer support tickets, reducing response times.</p>
                        <div class="project-details">
                            <h4>The Problem</h4>
                            <p>The client's customer support team was overwhelmed by a high volume of undifferentiated tickets, leading to **average response times of over 24 hours** and significant agent burnout. Tickets often landed with the wrong department, requiring manual re-routing.</p>

                            <h4>My Solution</h4>
                            <p>I designed and implemented a machine learning-powered **ticket classification system** using **Python (scikit-learn)** and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze ticket content. This system automatically routes tickets to the most appropriate department or agent, integrating with their existing CRM via a **RESTful API**.</p>

                            <h4>Measurable Results</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Average ticket response time reduced by **60% (from 24+ hours to less than 10 hours)**.</li>
                                <li>Agent workload re-distribution improved efficiency by **25%**.</li>
                                <li>Customer satisfaction scores (CSAT) increased by **15%**.</li>
                            </ul>

                                "The automated routing system built by [Your Name] has been a game-changer for our support team. Tickets are now handled much faster, and our agents can focus on solving problems instead of sorting them. An invaluable improvement!" - <cite>John Smith, Head of Customer Service at TechSolutions</cite>
